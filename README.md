## Introduction

The Nigerian economy relies heavily on foreign exchange rates. Understanding these rates can help businesses and individuals make informed decisions. This project aims to provide a simple and effective way to analyze exchange rate trends over time.

## Project Overview

This project includes:

- A Python script that fetches live exchange rate data from the CBN API.
- Data processing using Pandas for effective analysis.
- Visualizations created in Power BI to present trends clearly.

The project serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding exchange rates in Nigeria.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For scripting and data fetching.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development.
- **API**: To fetch live data from the CBN.
- **Web Scraping**: To gather additional data if necessary.
